======

Welcome to my personal website! I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, focusing on cutting-edge research at the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and medical imaging. Previously, I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh. Before joining RPI, I served as a lecturer at Daffodil International University, teaching courses ranging from Numerical Methods to Artificial Intelligence.
