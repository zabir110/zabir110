excerpt: 'Combating the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as one of the most promising issues in global healthcare. Accurate and fast diagnosis of COVID-19 cases is required for the right medical treatment to control this pandemic. Chest radiography imaging techniques are more effective than the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method in detecting coronavirus. Due to the limited availability of medical images, transfer learning is better suited to classify patterns in medical images. This paper presents a combined architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to diagnose COVID-19 patients from chest X-rays. The deep transfer techniques used in this experiment are VGG19, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and Inception-ResNetV2, where CNN is used to extract complex features from samples and classify them using RNN. In our experiments, the VGG19-RNN architecture outperformed all other networks in terms of accuracy. Finally, decision-making regions of images were visualized using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). The system achieved promising results compared to other existing systems and might be validated in the future when more samples would be available. The experiment demonstrated a good alternative method to diagnose COVID-19 for medical staff. All the data used during the study are openly available from the Mendeley data repository at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/mxc6vb7svm. For further research, we have made the source code publicly available at https://github.com/Asraf047/COVID19-CNN-RNN.'
